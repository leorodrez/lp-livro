**Shot sequence**

Um único palco: o ad-card-hero **fica ancorado no centro** (x 0, y -80px) durante os
quatro beats; o que muda é o que acontece em volta dele. Nenhum beat é um slide.

- **Cena A (0.0–2.0s) — "Você muda seus anúncios."** O card desacelera no centro. Sua
  composição interna troca entre duas versões por `scale-swap-transition` (hard
  swap com 140ms de compressão em scale, nunca crossfade). Câmera: tracking lateral
  curto de 60px, `power2.inOut`, que **termina antes** do texto estar completo.
  Texto em `statement` na faixa y 1180–1300.
- **Cena B (2.0–4.0s) — "Testa novos criativos."** O card se multiplica em três
  variantes visuais (entrada em cascata, stagger 0.08s — multiplicação organizada,
  nunca explosiva), que voltam a colapsar numa composição dominante em 3.4s.
  Câmera parada.
- **Cena C (4.0–6.0s) — "Ajusta campanhas."** Entram dois `campaign-control` abaixo
  do card: um slider e um stepper. Os handles deslizam e assentam
  (controle acoplado ao alvo), e o card responde — uma barra de orçamento acompanha.
  Pequeno deslocamento vertical de câmera (y -48px) entre 4.0 e 4.6s, depois para.
- **Cena D (6.0–9.0s) — "Analisa CPC, leads e vendas."** Três `metric-readout`
  entram integrados ao espaço (não flutuando sobre ele): **CPC**, **Leads**,
  **Vendas**. Os números rodam rápido (`counting-dynamic-scale`) por 900ms e
  **param para leitura** em 7.6s. Valores são demonstrativos de tela de produto.
  Hold de 1.2s. Em 8.4s os elementos começam a perder a forma de card.

## Selected blueprint: fixed-anchor-cycle

# fixed-anchor-cycle — Fixed Anchor, Cycling World

**intent**: One element is PINNED — a wordmark, a composer box, an anchor line that enters once and never moves again — while the adjacent region (or the entire surrounding theme) cycles through many discrete states around it, cadence often manipulated (steady stepping, a fast carousel, or a slow→accelerating flurry), resolving on an emphasis beat into a completed lockup or a muted freeze. The stillness of the anchor IS the claim: everything changes, this stays. Distinct from `kinetic-type-beats` sub-shape A, where a word-slot inside a centered line swaps and the sentence itself is the subject — there the anchor is a sentence frame on a bare type field; here the anchor is the PRODUCT identity and what cycles around it can be non-text (whole theme skins, chrome/logo swaps, textured label chips, a carousel list), the cycle asserts breadth ("everyone says / works everywhere / calling all X"), and the resolve completes the anchor into a lockup. Distinct from `ticker-takeover`, whose cycle ends in a collision — a hero crashes in and shoves the text aside; here nothing ever collides with the anchor: the cycle stops, and a final element quietly joins it.

**roles served**

- Brand_Outro (from `static-anchor-rapid-text-swaps`): when the sign-off is the brand name sitting immovable while praise quotes / tagline words cycle beside or beneath it — steady per-word highlight stepping, or a hard-cut chip flurry that accelerates — landing on the finished lockup ("bolt.new / prompt, run, edit, deploy / enjoy."; "Opus 4.6 by ANTHROP\C").
- Benefits: when "works everywhere" is shown literally — one product surface (a prompt composer with one verbatim string) pinned dead-center while its ENTIRE shell morphs in place through N product themes (background, typography, radii, chrome, logos all crossfading at once), ending in a washed-out freeze.
- Hook: when the opener is a roll-call — a static anchor line holds while an accent-colored line beneath it runs as a fast vertical carousel through an audience/option list, then the block clears into follow-up statement beats that land the brand line.

**duration**: 6.6–11.1s (Benefits shortest ~6.6s at 4 theme beats; Brand_Outro ~9–9.4s; Hook longest ~11s when the anchor-cycle block hands off to follow-up statement beats). The cycle engine itself occupies ~3–5s regardless of role.

**shot structure** (flat static frame — camera locked in every member; a `[bg]` field, solid or subtly drifting; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) adjacent-region cycle**: the anchor holds and a neighboring slot swaps through N states; **(B) whole-context morph**: the anchor holds and everything AROUND it re-skins in place)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~2.0s) — the anchor lands and PINS.** The `[anchor: wordmark / product name / composer box / lead line]` enters once — fade/scale-in centered, word-by-word build, or already present at frame one — at a fixed position it will hold for the entire clip. Zero movement from here on: no drift, no breathe, no re-layout. If the anchor is a UI surface (sub-shape B), it carries a `[verbatim string]` with a blinking cursor.

- **Scene 2 (~2.0s–~70% of runtime) — the cycle engine (signature move).** The world changes around the unmoved anchor. Choose by sub-shape:
  - **Sub-shape A (adjacent-region cycle)**: a region beside/beneath the anchor steps through N discrete states — pick ONE swap mechanic and ONE cadence:
    - _swap mechanics_: instant hard-cut label replacement (a `[chip / tape label]` slaps over the old one, texture/highlight shifting slightly, chip width re-fitting each `[phrase]` — growing away from the anchor, never over it); sequential per-word highlight stepping (one word of the `[tagline]` snaps bright/bold while the rest sits dim grey, the highlight walking the line); or a fast vertical carousel (each `[list item]` slide/fades through the accent slot ~0.5s/phrase).
    - _cadences_: steady stepping (~0.5–1s/state), or **slow→accelerating flurry** — ~1s beats compressing to ~0.15–0.3s per swap, breadth escalating into a blur of states (12–16 states read as "everyone"; 3–8 read as a roll-call).
    - Geometry law: the cycling region NEVER overlaps, touches, or displaces the anchor; size the layout so the longest state still fits inside the frame with clear margins.
  - **Sub-shape B (whole-context morph)**: at ~1.3s intervals the entire theme — `[bg color]`, typography, corner radii, toolbar icons, footer `[brand logos]`, contextual lines — morphs in place via quick (~0.3s) crossfades through N `[product skins]`, every property blending simultaneously. No hard cuts, no wipes; the anchor's content string is identical in every skin (chrome details like a `> ` prefix may adapt per skin).

- **Scene 3 (~70–85%) — the emphasis beat.** The cycle resolves — it does not just stop:
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (highlight stepping)_: the whole `[tagline]` snaps solid bright at once — full-line illumination after the per-word walk.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (flurry)_: the flurry halts and HOLDS on the `[longest / weightiest phrase]` — a beat of stillness after acceleration.
  - _Variant — Benefits (theme morph)_: the final beat mutes — a faint `[dot-grid]` fades in across the background while the UI drops to low opacity, a washed-out blueprint freeze.
  - _Variant — Hook (carousel)_: the anchor block clears, handing off to 1–3 centered word-by-word statement beats (kinetic-type-beats territory) that carry toward the close.

- **Scene 4 (final beat → end) — lockup completion and HOLD.** A final element joins the still-unmoved anchor and the finished composition holds static to the end: a `[closing word]` drops in below, aligned to the last cycled state ("enjoy."); the chip vanishes on a hard cut and the `[brand sign-off]` appears beside the anchor on a shared baseline ("by ANTHROP\C"); or the final `[brand line]` builds word-by-word dead-center and holds ("with Copilot."). Long static hold — the lockup is the payoff, give it 20–30% of the runtime.

**motion vocabulary**: anchor fade/scale-in entrance; permanently pinned anchor (zero movement, no idle breathe); instant hard-cut label/chip replacement (slap-over with subtle texture/highlight shift); chip width resize-to-fit per phrase (grows away from the anchor); sequential per-word highlight stepping through a line; dim-to-grey line state; whole-line illumination snap; fast vertical carousel slide/fade of one line under a static line; cadence acceleration (slow ~1s beats into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry); hold-on-longest-phrase emphasis beat; in-place theme morph crossfade (~0.3s) blending background/fonts/radii/icons simultaneously; per-beat chrome/logo swap; blinking text cursor; contextual line appearing/disappearing across beats; dot-grid backdrop fade-in; global opacity washout; end freeze; word-by-word phrase build; block clear between scenes; drop-in entrance of a final word; hard cut to final lockup; long static hold.

**rule mapping**

- instant hard-cut chip/label/phrase swaps at time thresholds; per-word highlight stepping (color/weight state swaps); dim-line → full-line illumination snap; per-state chip width set (a per-state layout property, set discretely — never tweened) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- fast vertical carousel of the accent line under the static anchor (slide/fade stepped swaps in a masked slot) → `vertical-spring-ticker` (its footer-reveal step unused — Scene 4's lockup takes its place)
- per-phrase state windows computed from a script of N states (praise quotes, audience list, theme beats) → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (Accelerating cadence — for the flurry, pre-compute the beat array with shrinking `hold` values, geometric decay over the state list)
- word-by-word phrase builds (anchor line, follow-up statements, final brand line) → `dynamic-content-sequencing` + `waterfall-entry` (or `kinetic-beat-slam` when the statements should land percussively)
- anchor entrance fade/scale-in; drop-in of the final closing word → `spring-pop-entrance` (restrained overshoot — the register here is editorial, not bouncy)
- blinking cursor in the pinned composer → `context-sensitive-cursor` (color adapts per theme skin at segment boundaries)
- whole-context theme morph → `theme-crossfade-morph` (N pre-styled full-scene layers stacked at the same geometry, opacity-crossfaded, the shared anchor string rendered once on top); the composer shell's radius/surface component alone → `card-morph-anchor`
- subtly drifting background field beneath the cycle → `sine-wave-loop` (bounded drift; the anchor itself gets none)
- dot-grid fade-in + global opacity washout freeze; long static hold → `gsap-effects` (plain opacity tweens) / static hold (no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: none — every member is fully camera-static; the cycle is the only motion, and the pinned anchor's stillness is load-bearing. Do not add a push-in "for energy"; it would break the anchor contract.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

## Selected motion rule: counting-dynamic-scale

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |

| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |
| SUFFIX_DUR            | 0.3–0.6s                                    | fires at `COUNT_DUR`, never during the count                                  |
| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.
